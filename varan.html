            Varanasi is one of the oldest living cities in the world. its
            Prominence in Hindu mythology is Virtually unrevealed. Mark Twain,
            The English Author and liturature, who was enthralled by the
            legendand santcity of Benaras, once wrote , "Benaras is older than
            history,older than tradition, older even than legend and looks twice
            as old as all of them put together."

            The best time period for visiting Varanasi is from October to March,
            when the weather is not so hot and it is dry. November to February
            is the peak season, when crowds and higher prices are expected.Rainy
            season is from late June to September. It is still possible to tour
            Varanasi in these months, but get ready for the humidity and rain.
            Lower prices and less-crowded attractions are the rewards.
